          While we are proud of the services we provide to the world for free and try to make them reliable and
          useful, we make no promises about them. All web services are certain to fail some of the time. We adapt
          and change our services from time to time, so you may find that something that worked for you may cease 
          to work. We may also stop supplying any service, temporarily or permanently or block access to our serv-
          ices to anyone for any reason.
          
          If you need some guarantee of a particular service level, then please do not hesitate to contact us to 
          discuss whether we could offer you a commercial version of any of ourservices (assuming one is not alre-
          ady available).
          
          We are not a law firm and nothing we do is intended to be taken as legal advice. In particular:
          
          We encourage the use of our open data commons licences but we cannot give any warranty that they will
          work in the way expected or should be used for any specific purpose. If in doubt, you should take your
          own legal advice. The API supplied with our Public Domain Works project is not guaranteed to provide an
          answer with 100% certainty. Copyright law is complex and there may be obscure cases that are not handled
          correctly. It is intended to be a starting point, not the word of God.</p></pre></div>
